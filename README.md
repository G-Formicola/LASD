A set of dynamic data structures for generic types which includes :
- Container - An abstract data structure 
- Vector - A simple vector 
- List - A single linked list 
- Stack - Two versions of the stack, one implemented using a vector, and one using a list
- Queue - Two versions of the queue, as the stack, one using a vector and the otherone a list
- Binary Tree - Two versions of Binary Tree, one with the vector of nodes, and one with pointers to nodes
- Binary Search Tree - One version on the BST implemented with a BinaryTree built with pointers to nodes
- HashTable - Two versions of HT, one who resolves conflicts with Open Addressing and the otherone with Closed Addressing
#
The library has been developed using object oriented programming techniques and C++ as programming language. 
Thanks to template offered by C++ the data structures are independent from the type of the object stored inside, 
the user just have to specify it when instantiating. The library includes a simple user interface usefull for testing
the code, thanks to a test battery given by Professor Fabio Mogavero. For compiling give execution privilge to build.sh with chmod u+x from terminal and run it.
